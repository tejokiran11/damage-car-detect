As part of the Mobile Application Development course at Amrita School of Computing, we developed VehicleDamageAI: Assessment, an AI-powered app focused on Car damage detection through automotive analysis. The app is designed to assist within the automated vehicle damage assessment and enables for insurance claims processing and repair estimation.
Our project utilizes the damage_type_dataset to train several deep learning models, including CNN, DenseNet, Mask R-CNN, RetinaNet and Fast R-CNN. Testing revealed that Mask R-CNN provided the highest accuracy at 93%, followed closely by DenseNet at 85% and CNN at 82%. The dataset can be accessed here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-I5Ee9sVWm47y0-HvUj3-ooDisVOZhSC?usp=sharing].
The complete source code for VehicleDamageAI is open-source and available on GitHub: [https://github.com/tejokiran11/damage-car-detect].
